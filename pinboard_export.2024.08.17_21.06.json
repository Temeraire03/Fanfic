Sam seems to want them live a normal kind of life, but between the ridiculous estate sale Sam bought to furnish the house, the arrival of a very human Castiel who's overwhelmed by human emotions, and their quirky, invasive neighbors, it's anything but. Dean's having a difficult time adjusting, convinced everything couldn't be more abnormal until Sam reveals exactly what kind of life he wants to have with Dean. Dean can't deny the part of him that wants it--but can he accept it?\n.\nDean's issues and insecurities just scream 'Dean Winchester' and the strain of trying to settle into domestic life is difficult for all of the characters - and, man, isn't it interesting watching them try? This story is quirky and fun, but with enough and spicy sex to make it a well rounded read.","meta":"c65eac524f80fd0d9dbc41e9b9f55626","hash":"352f0edebec7b2ec69967444827b9464","time":"2012-06-18T21:30:49Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"sam\/dean spn read!later"},

I've noticed that you've been posting several pieces from the Thor comics. I'd love to read them, but seeing as you're on #600+, where does a newbie even start? Wiki tells me Thor debuted in #83. But where did you start reading? And do you know what comic #'s are the most brother-centric? Or which ones deal with Loki? :D Thank you so much, seriously.\n azuritebright\nIt warms my Asgardian soul to hear you say that you want to read the comics. I know how daunting this may seem, but I would love to help you get started. :3\nPersonally, I think you should start with a more recent run of Thor and work forward. Then, when you are caught up you can work backwards. It\u2019s easiest to handle one chunk at a time. Going all the way back to the beginning is just tedious.\nLoki is also a constant presence in the newest ones so I think you would approve. \nHere is the order I would suggest: Thor V3 1-12, Thor 600-621, Journey Into Mystery 622-638\/The Mighty Thor 1-14","meta":"a6ffb35b5a6ff7715ce0a79eeff9f85d","hash":"77a9684f6c03e53a487691079a57e932","time":"2012-06-03T04:57:00Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""},

You have to open up your sinuses and upper vocal tract before you start to speak. To make this happen, make believe you are yawning..and feel the area open up. This is exactly the thing professionals do right before that big voice comes out. It becomes totally un-conscious for them. What this does is effectively make a bigger speaker cabinet for your voice to come from. If you do this before speaking (especially when you are in a noisy environment or during public speaking) you will use less effort and strain in making the sound you need to be heard.\n\nTake in a good volume of air, flare out the area in the nose and throat, and let your whole vocal tract resonate freely as you create the words. It may seem un-natural at first, but it helps tremendously in lowering the effort required to vocalize \u2013 and can be a key element in good throat care.

Suddenly finding himself surrounded by wolves, Spencer must come to terms with his own heritage, learn what it means to be part of a team and a pack, all while training to become a profiler for the FBI.\n\nAfter mating and bonding with his pack leader, Derek Morgan never expected that there could be anyone else. But when Spencer Reid joins the team, Derek has to accept his past before he can look to his future.\n\nUnit Chief and pack leader Aaron Hotchner has his own set of worries. In between balancing the demands of the job with the needs of his pack he does his best to keep everyone safe and well. The members of his pack sometimes make this more of a challenge than he could have ever anticipated.","meta":"3eed5b21d48cf67ae6e9de169df197ab","hash":"673bbcb58acafd3721df2f7656fc9e36","time":"2012-02-26T02:35:32Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"Criminal Minds"},

He feels the need to protect the kid and he personally takes a sickly Kirk back to Earth, where he leaves him with Pike. Years later, Kirk and McCoy meet on that shuttle, because Pike called Reaper!McCoy and told him Kirk was joining Star Fleet and could use a friend. From the start, Kirk thinks there's something familiar about McCoy, but it's not until post events of the movie that the truth comes out. Happy ending for the boys.","meta":"5a2b5f3c161a9fb91eb8622c8c1fb086","hash":"9fb75cd96da06bb1c35728708a0b15fb","time":"2011-08-19T21:26:12Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"reaper!bones Star Trek tarsusIV au star!trek"},

The aggregation of a-syn is the major component of intraneuronal inclusions, Lewy bodies, which are neuropathological features, observed in Parkinson\u2019s disease, Lewy body dementia, and other synucleopathies. Diverse cellular events can contribute to a-syn accumulation, aggregation, and to subsequent Lewy body formation. These factors include genetic mutations of synuclein, parkin, or the deubiquitinating enzyme, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1), leading to reduced clearance of a-syn by the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway (UPP). Furthermore, intracellular insults include environmental factors and an age-related decrement in antioxidant defense systems that increase oxidative stress and can affect either the accumulation or clearance of a-syn.","meta":"02372c5441c347364579187e7de7cc4f","hash":"f4b98e9abd1b2542d95976ebc4c75d28","time":"2011-04-10T01:03:45Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"anatomy"},
